# AI-generated-chemical-materials
A PyTorch implementation of generative models to generate novel chemical materials.

To run training,
1. Fine the zipped data directory at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GOUW9sNOYQhtz_zJTCHhSZuEGxrobgZ_/view?usp=sharing.
2. Unzip data.zip and place the unzipped data folder in the root directory.
<<<<<<< HEAD
3. Run setup.sh by running ./setup.sh in terminal. If you're running the training for the first time, the code will
ask for a WandB API key. Enter a valid API key. This command should run the src/models/sweep.py file which contains the configuration parameters used in our tinypaper.
